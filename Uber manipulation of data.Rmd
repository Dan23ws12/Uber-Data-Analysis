```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Data Manipulation Section:
I created a function to split the Datetime in the Date/Time column into date, weakday, month, hour, minute and second
The function was

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
